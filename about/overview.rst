Marsyas is a software framework for rapid prototyping and experimentation with
audio analysis and synthesis with specific emphasis to music signals and
`Music Information Retrieval`_.
The basic goal is to provide a general, extensible and flexible architecture
that allows easy experimentation with algorithms and provides fast performance
that is useful in developing real time audio analysis and synthesis tools.

A variety of existing building blocks that form the basis of most published
algorithms in Computer Audition are already available as part of the framework
and extending the framework with new components/building blocks is
straightforward.
