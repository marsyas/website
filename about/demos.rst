Cantillion
==========

  :target: http://cantillion.sness.net/


Cantillion is a web based Flash application that allows ethnomusiologists around
the world to explore tropes and gestures from partially annotated chant
traditions from around the world. We are working on using Marsyas to generate
the pitch contours and to perform Dynamic Time Warping similiarity calculations
between different tropes.

MarGrid online
==============

  :target: http://margrid.sness.net/

MarGrid online is a Flash based web application that allows users to
interactively browse a two-dimensional representation of different collections
of music. The 2D representations are generated using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
which maps a high dimensional feature space to two dimensions. Both the feature
extraction and SOM algorithm are calculated using Marsyas.


MarGrid Tags
============

MarGrid Tags is a Flash based web application that allows users to interactively
browse a two-dimensional representation of different collections of music. The
2D representations are generated using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) which maps a
high dimensional feature space to two dimensions. Both the feature extraction
and SOM algorithm are calculated using Marsyas.

Panning Pedagogy
================

http://pan.sness.net/

A Flash application that, using Marsyas, takes audio data, calculates the
spectrum for the left and right channels, and calculates the Stereo Panning
Spectrum from this data. It is then graphically displayed in a web application.
Look for similar programs inside of Marsyas that display this data using 3D
OpenGL.

Neil's Skookum MarSystem Network Constructor
============================================

http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~inb/work/mna/index.html

A Java web applet built with Processing that allows users to construct Marsyas
networks inside a web browser.
